# Min_Cost_Arborescence
Algorithm to find minimum spanning tree in a directed graph. <br/>
# Input Format
First line: Number of Test Cases T and then follows their description <br/>
For each test case, <br/>
first row indicate N M s (single space separated) where <br/>
-> N is number of vertices in directed graph where vertices are labelled 1 to N (not 0 indexing) <br/>
-> M is the number of edges and <br/>
-> s is the index of source vertex <br/>
And then M rows mentioning u v w(u,v) (single space separated, where u and v are vertex ids and w is <br/>
weight, Safely assume all edge weights are non-negative, else print -1 for the output)
