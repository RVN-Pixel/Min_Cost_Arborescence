# Min_Cost_Arborescence
Algorithm to find minimum spanning tree in a directed graph
First line: Number of Test Cases T and then follows their description
For each test case,
first row indicate N M s (single space separated)
where
N is number of vertices in directed graph where vertices are labelled 1 to N (not 0 indexing)
M is the number of edges and
s is the index of source vertex
And then M rows mentioning u v w(u,v) (single space separated, where u and v are vertex ids and w is
weight, Safely assume all edge weights are non-negative, else print -1 for the output)
